# InstructionOS

A 32-bit, x86 operating system written in C. 

InstructionOS is a hobby operating system written with a particular interest in test-driven development and comprehensive unit test coverage integrated from the beginning, something other kernels severely lack.

## Features

* Bootloader written in NASM assembly
* Kernel written in ANSI C
* Build toolchain written in Makefiles
* GRUB Multiboot Specification v1 compliant
* Full 32-bit protected mode
* Comprehensive unit test coverage
* VGA text mode 

## Progress

InstructionOS isn't a fully-fledged 'operating system', but it does boot and is being actively developed. The obligatory screenshot (which is pretty underwhelming at the moment) is here:
